**Project Overview**:

In this project, you'll dive into the world of web development and get hands-on experience with HTML. You'll create a simple portfolio webpage for "CodeSpace Cat" from scratch, based on a provided reference image. This project is designed to help you understand the fundamental elements of HTML, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and forms, while building an actual webpage.

**Project Objectives**:

- Gain a basic understanding of HTML tags and how they're used in web development.
- Create the structure of a webpage, including headers, sections, images, and forms.
- Practice writing HTML code by recreating the given reference structure.
- Apply the skills you've learned to build a webpage.
- Familiarize yourself with common HTML elements used in web development.

**Project Requirements**:

1. **HTML Structure**: Your task is to create an HTML file that resembles the provided reference structure. You'll need to use various HTML tags like `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and section elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<img>`, `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>`.

2. **Content**: Populate each section of the webpage with appropriate content. This includes adding a title, header, navigation links, about me information, skills list, portfolio table, contact form, and footer.

3. **Images**: Use the images provided in the assets folder for the profile picture and portfolio thumbnails.

4. **Links**: Create navigation links that point to the corresponding sections within your webpage using the `href` attribute.

5. **Form**: Implement a simple contact form with fields for name, email, and a message. Ensure that the form has proper labels and input elements.

**Deliverables**:

1. **HTML File**: Your submission should be an HTML file that accurately replicates the structure and content of the provided reference.

2. **Images**: Make sure you include the images (profile picture and portfolio thumbnails) in your HTML file correctly.

**Grading Criteria**:

- Accuracy in reproducing the provided reference structure.
- Correct usage of HTML elements and attributes.
- Properly linked navigation menu.
- Inclusion of images with correct references.
- A functional contact form with appropriate input fields and labels.

**Additional Tips**:

- Pay attention to details like indentation and proper tag nesting to keep your HTML code clean and readable.
- Use semantic HTML tags to structure your content logically.
- Feel free to ask for feedback or guidance if you're unsure about anything.

# Getting Started with your Project Starter Files

You have everything you need to start your project using the project file and starter code provided in the GitHub repo. This repo contains the starter boilerplate code which you can clone to get yourself up and running. 

In the project folder you will find the references images so you can see what sections of the CodeSpace Cat portfolio you are required to build (See images labelled "sections_1" and "sections_2"). The project folder also contains a short video showing you the sections of the page and what your final project should look like. 

The Starter code includes the base HTML file labelled "index.html" which has the boilerplate HTML where you will add your code to complete the project. Note that the project starter code includes a folder labelled "images" which contains the that holds the images you will need to add to your project.
